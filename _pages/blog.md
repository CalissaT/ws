### APCSP 

I joined APCSP relatively new to coding, and pretty garbage at it. I remember making my "About Me Page" at the beginning of tri one, which was coded in HTML and consisted of an image and a couple <p> tags. I felt like I was about to be the next Bill Gates with these skills, but I was proven very wrong during the rest of the course.

Most of the time when Mr. M held TechTalks or our technical officers had a presentation on key topics, I used every ounce of my brain power to try and figure out what they were even talking about. Obviously, it didn't work, and I spent most of the class very lost, stressed, and a little sad. 

However, through this struggle I learned the magic of StackOverflow and my very smart teammates Akhil and Avinh. Whenever I had a I problem, I asked them and they would always help me. The very few instances in which they didn't know why my code was broken, I went to Mr. M. 

Now, this doesn't sound like a very productive way to go through a computer science class, but as the class progressed, I slowly began learning more and more. Although I am no Anthony (an absolute legend), there were days when I made something good enough to make me feel like I was. 

As the AP test approached, I genuinely thought I was going to fail because I was pretty incompetent and didn't understand major concepts on College Board. So, I went on the grind, and started watching more CB videos and doing thorough test corrections on the practice AP tests we did in class.
