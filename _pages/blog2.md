### Week 13

I started working on the College Board FRQ 1 before doing Mr. M's more advanced hacks. I felt that this would be a better start for me since I struggle a lot with the Java concepts. I was kind of able to figure out how to do FRQ 1 by myself, so I moved onto the hacks. I made a couple methods myself, but ended up working with Evan on the harder ones. Honestly, he figured it out and made most of it because I had no idea what to do. He helped me understand what his code does which is very appreciated. We were also supposed to figure out how to add more endpoints, but I barely know what an endpoint is so I couldn't do that.

### Turkey

Over turkey, I tried to do FRQ 2. I realized I have no idea what is going on but I remained determined to at least finish part of the hacks. I had some people help me because I didn't even know where to start and I was able to finish a few of the hacks. I somewhat understand what I did, and I hope to do better on future assignments. 

### Week 14

I've been working on the vocab this week and it has been quite nice to slow down on the FRQs and take time to expand my Java knowledge. On Wednesday, my scrum team presented our presentation for the arrayList lesson and I think it went pretty well.
