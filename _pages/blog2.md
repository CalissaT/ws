### Week 13

I started working on the College Board FRQ 1 before doing Mr. M's more advanced hacks. I felt that this would be a better start for me since I struggle a lot with the Java concepts. I was kind of able to figure out how to do FRQ 1 by myself, so I moved onto the hacks. I made a couple methods myself, but ended up working with Evan on the harder ones. Honestly, he figured it out and made most of it because I had no idea what to do. He helped me understand what his code does which is very appreciated. We were also supposed to figure out how to add more endpoints, but I barely know what an endpoint is so I couldn't do that.
