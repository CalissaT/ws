### Capture Information Plan:

This is where I will store most of my general notes. If there is specific information either college board or PBL, I will label it by unit or lab.

### Key Terms in Java:
- The main method is where the program starts running.
- Objects are an instance of a class. Objects can have attributes. For instance, a Student object might have name and grade as attributes.
- A class is a programmer defined blueprint from which objects are created.
- A parameter is a variable in the method/constructor signature that defines the type of value to receive when the method or constructor is called.
- An argument is a value passed to a method or constructor when the method or constructor is called.
- Subclass is a class that extends a suerclass and inherits its attributes and behaviors
- Inheritence is an OOP principle where a subclass inherits the attributes nad behaviors of a superclass

### 8/30 Using Objects
- Public means availible everywhere
- Final means that its not going anywhere
- myPainter.move();
    -  (.) notation means that you're using objects
    -  Refrencing data property or refrencing method
    -  myPainter is object
    -  .move(); is a method
