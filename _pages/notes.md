Notes! 

Overview of Java:
- The main method is where the program starts running.
- Objects are an instance of a class. Objects can have attributes. For instance, a Student object might have name and grade as attributes.
- A class is a programmer defined blueprint from which objects are created.
- A parameter is a variable in the method/constructor signature that defines the type of value to receive when the method or constructor is called.
- An argument is a value passed to a method or constructor when the method or constructor is called.
