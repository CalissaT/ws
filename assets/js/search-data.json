            "content": "The Problem . I tried to run a simple java code segment in my note book but it gave me this error . Failed to start the Kernel. Kernel Java is not usable . The Solution . Disclaimer: There is definitely a more convenient way to do this, and since I am not an expert I realize that I have like zero idea what I’m talking about . Step 1: Uninstall basically everything on your computer . pip3 uninstall jupyter pip3 uninstall jupyter_core pip3 uninstall jupyter-client pip3 uninstall jupyter-console pip3 uninstall notebook pip3 uninstall qtconsole pip3 uninstall nbconvert pip3 uninstall nbformat pip uninstall ipykernel pip uninstall jupyterlab-server pip uninstall jupyterlab . I got these commands from a very nice lady on GitHub Link . Step 2: Start reinstalling things . I have no idea what those lines deleted but just I just followed Mr. M’s commands to reinstall things that I probably already had installed but I just wanted to make sure . $ brew list # list packages $ brew update # update package list $ brew upgrade # upgrade packages $ brew install git # install latest git $ brew install python # install python3 for development $ python --version # version of python3 installed $ brew install java # openjdk install $ java --version # version of runtime $ javac --version # version of compiler (base) id:~$ conda --version (base) id:~$ conda install jupyter # install jupyter (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list installed kernels (base) id:~$ # start in home directory (base) id:~$ pip install bash_kernel # download bash kernel . This is when I realized that there might be something wrong with my bash because it gave me a weird response, and this is where I discovered that it was in fact broken . Step 3: Fix Bash . pip uninstall bash_kernel pip install bash_kernel . It then give me a list of conflicts because the things we needed installed were uninstalled . Type this commands into terminal: . conda install -c conda-forge rtree . For more information click: Link . Then, uninstall and reinstall bash again . pip uninstall bash_kernel pip install bash_kernel . That should work! .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
