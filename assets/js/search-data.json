Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type. . Widening: (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size . Narrowing: (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type . // casting in the case of division public class division{ public static void main(String args[]){ int a = 2; int b = 3; System.out.println(b/a); } } division.main(null); . 1 . public class casting{ public static void main(String args[]){ int a = 2; double b = a; double c = 2.99; int d = (int)c; System.out.println(&quot;Widening&quot;); System.out.println(a); System.out.println(b); System.out.println(&quot;&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Narrowing&quot;); System.out.println(c); System.out.println(d); } } casting.main(null); . Widening 2 2.0 Narrowing 2.99 2 . Wrapper Classes . In cases such as arrayLists, sometimes data can only be stored as objects. To get around this, we used wrapper classes to store primitive data types as objects. . These wrapper classes also have corresponding methods . ArrayList&lt;int&gt; myNumbers = new ArrayList&lt;int&gt;(); // it cannot store integers . | ArrayList&lt;int&gt; myNumbers = new ArrayList&lt;int&gt;(); // it cannot store integers unexpected type required: reference found: int | ArrayList&lt;int&gt; myNumbers = new ArrayList&lt;int&gt;(); // it cannot store integers unexpected type required: reference found: int . ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; myNumbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); // stores the object as an integer wrapper class . Concatenation . Concatenation is combining two or more strings using the &quot;+&quot;, &quot;+=&quot;, or concat() method . You must use the Datatype.toString(var) method to convert different datatypes to strings . public class concat{ public static void main(String args[]){ String text1 = &quot;ora&quot;; String text2 = &quot;nge&quot;; String fruit1 = text1 + text2; String fruit2 = text1.concat(text2); System.out.println(fruit1); System.out.println(fruit2); } } concat.main(null); . orange orange . Math Class . The Java Math class provides several methods to perform calculations and other functions involving numbers. . public class random{ public static void main(String args[]){ double random = Math.random(); System.out.println(random); } } random.main(null); . 0.4452733827420724 . Compound Boolean Expressions . Using the (AND) &amp;&amp; and (OR) || operations in conditionals . public class compoundBooleans { public static void main(String args[]){ int a = 1; if (a &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; a &gt; 0){ System.out.println(&quot;a is between 0 and 10&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;a is either negative or greater than 10&quot;); } } } compoundBooleans.main(null); . a is between 0 and 10 . Truth Tables . Booleans return only true or false, and we use truth tables to organize the outputs of an operation . a=true, b=false, c=true, d=true . | AND OR XOR . A, B False | True | True | . C, D True | True | False | . De Morgan&#39;s Law . A law that simplifies boolean expressions . Examples: !(a &amp;&amp; b) is equivalent to !a || !b !(a || b) is equivalent to !a &amp;&amp; !b . Comparing Numbers . You can use the compare() method or an == operator to compare two different numeric values. . The compare() method returns 0 if true, -1 if value one is less than value two, and 1 if value one is greater than value two . public class comparingNumbers { public static void main(String args[]){ int a = 3; int b = 3; System.out.println(Integer.compare(a, b)); System.out.println(a == b); } } comparingNumbers.main(null); . 0 true . Comparing Strings . There are many ways to compare strings. Some of the common ways include using the String.equals() method . Here is a link to other possible methods . public class comparingStrings { public static void main(String args[]){ String fruit = new String(&quot;Banana&quot;); String fruit2 = new String(&quot;Banana&quot;); System.out.println(fruit.equals(fruit2)); } } comparingStrings.main(null); . true . Comparing Objects . Similarly to numbers and strings, you can use the == operators or the equals() method. . == will see if the objects have the same identity, while .equals will see if the objects hold the same value . It is also common to use the assert method which must be imported. Here are outside examples . public class comparingObjects { public static void main(String args[]){ Integer a = new Integer(1); Integer b = new Integer(1); if(a.equals(b)){ System.out.println(&quot;true&quot;); } else{ System.out.println(&quot;false&quot;); } } } comparingObjects.main(null); . true . For Loops and Enhanced For Loops . For loops are a great tool for iteration. For loops can be incremented by whatever value you wish, while enhanced for loops (for-each) must execute code in a sequence. . Enhanced for loops are often used to traverse arrays/arrayLists . import java.io.*; import java.util.*; public class forLoops{ public static void main(String args[]) { //for loop for (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i+=2 ){ System.out.print(&quot;Code &quot;); } //enhanced for loop int[] num = { 1, 2, 3}; for (int a : num) { System.out.print(a); } } } forLoops.main(null); . Code Code Code 123 . While Loop vs. Do While Loop . While loops execute a block of code while a condition is true . While do loops execute code until a condition is true . public class whileLoop{ public static void main(String args[]) { //while loop int a = 3; while ( a &gt; 0 ){ System.out.print(&quot;code &quot;); a--; } //while do loop int b = 3; do { System.out.println(b); a++; } while (b &gt; 7); } } whileLoop.main(null); . code code code 3 . Nested Loops . Nested loops are loops within loops . public class nestedLoops { public static void main(String[] args) { int weeks = 2; int days = 7; // outer loop prints weeks for (int i = 1; i &lt;= weeks; ++i) { System.out.println(&quot;Week: &quot; + i); // inner loop prints days for (int j = 1; j &lt;= days; ++j) { System.out.println(&quot; Day: &quot; + j); } } } } nestedLoops.main(null); . Week: 1 Day: 1 Day: 2 Day: 3 Day: 4 Day: 5 Day: 6 Day: 7 Week: 2 Day: 1 Day: 2 Day: 3 Day: 4 Day: 5 Day: 6 Day: 7 . Creating a Class . Constructor . Accessor Methods . Mutator Methods .

Part B . Write the static method dayOfWeek, which returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the given date (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, 2019 began on a Tuesday, and January 5 is the fifth day of 2019. As a result, January 5, 2019, fell on a Saturday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 5, 2019) returns 6. .

For the first day of the year, January 1 (month = 1, day = 1), the value 1 is returned. This method accounts for whether year is a leap year. For example, dayOfYear(3, 1, 2017) returns 60, since 2017 is not a leap year, while dayOfYear(3, 1, 2016) returns 61, since 2016 is a leap year. | . import java.util.Calendar; import java.util.GregorianCalendar; public class APCalendar { /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., * and 6 denotes Saturday. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) { int divisor = 7; /* divides by seven and uses remainder to determine what day of the week it is int day1 = 7; //sunday int day2 = 8; //monday int day3 = 9; //tuesday */ int daysIntoYear = firstDayOfYear(year) + dayOfYear(month, day, year) -1; /* Adds the first day of the year, and then how many days its been in the year.

            "content": "If-Else Statements . If-Else statements are conditional statements that determine which section of code to run. . /* Example 1: If condition is not true, else is executed */ int x = 5; // variable x if (x&lt;4){ // the line of code within the if statement will not be executed as x is not less than 4 System.out.println(&quot;X is less than 4&quot;); } else { // the line of code within the else statement is executed because first condition is not true System.out.println(&quot;X is greater than 4&quot;); } . X is greater than 4 . /* Example 2: If condition is true, else is not executed */ int x = 3; // variable x if (x&lt;4){ // the line of code within the if statement will be executed as x is less than 4 System.out.println(&quot;X is less than 4&quot;); } else { // the line of code within the else statement is not executed because first condition is true System.out.println(&quot;X is greater than 4&quot;); } . X is less than 4 . If-Elseif-Else Statements . If-Elseif-Else statements are another conditional statement, this time with 3 different code segments to execute from. Both the if and elseif need a condition, while the else does not. . /* Example 3: If condition false, else if condition true. Else if code is executed */ int x = 2; // variable x if (x&lt;4 &amp;&amp; x&gt;3 ){ // the line of code within the if statement will not be executed, as x is not between 3 and 4 System.out.println(&quot;X is less than 4&quot;); } else if (x == 2){ // the line of code within the else if statement is executed as x is equal to 2 System.out.println(&quot;X is equal to 2&quot;); } else { // the line of code within the else statement is not executed because the previous condition is true System.out.println(&quot;X is greater than 4&quot;); } . X is equal to 2 . Switch-case . There are many ways to write code. In the case of conditionals, a switch case can be used to replace a if-elseif-else statement. In a switch statement, one of many code blocks will be executed. . // this is an if-else-else statement String cheese = &quot;Gouda&quot;; if (cheese == &quot;Cheddar&quot;){ // tests if cheese = cheddar System.out.println(&quot;Cheddar originated in Somerset&quot;); } else if (cheese == &quot;Gouda&quot;){ // tests if cheese = gouda System.out.println(&quot;Gouda originated in the Netherlands&quot;); } else if (cheese == &quot;Milk&quot;){ // tests if cheese = milk System.out.println(&quot;Milk is made from cows, goats, and other mammals&quot;); } else if (cheese == &quot;Cheese&quot;){ // tests if cheese = cheese System.out.println(&quot;Cheese is very yummy&quot;); } else{ // if cheese is none of these System.out.println(&quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t have any information about &quot; + cheese); } . Gouda originated in the Netherlands . //the statement above can also be written like: String cheese = &quot;Gouda&quot;; switch(cheese) { case &quot;Cheddar&quot;: // tests if cheese = cheddar System.out.println(&quot;Cheddar originated in Somerset&quot;); break; case &quot;Gouda&quot;: // tests if cheese = gouda System.out.println(&quot;Gouda originated in the Netherlands&quot;); break; case &quot;Milk&quot;: // tests if cheese = milk System.out.println(&quot;Milk is made from cows, goats, and other mammals&quot;); break; case &quot;Cheese&quot;: // tests if cheese = cheese System.out.println(&quot;Cheese is very yummy&quot;); default: // if cheese is none of these System.out.println(&quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t have any information about &quot; + cheese); } . Gouda originated in the Netherlands . De Morgan&#39;s Law . De Morgan&#39;s Law illustrates how compound boolean expressions are read.

            "content": "The Problem . I tried to run a simple java code segment in my note book but it gave me this error . Failed to start the Kernel. Kernel Java is not usable . The Solution . Disclaimer: There is definitely a more convenient way to do this, and since I am not an expert I realize that I have like zero idea what I’m talking about . Step 1: Uninstall basically everything on your computer . pip3 uninstall jupyter pip3 uninstall jupyter_core pip3 uninstall jupyter-client pip3 uninstall jupyter-console pip3 uninstall notebook pip3 uninstall qtconsole pip3 uninstall nbconvert pip3 uninstall nbformat pip uninstall ipykernel pip uninstall jupyterlab-server pip uninstall jupyterlab . I got these commands from a very nice lady on GitHub Link . Step 2: Start reinstalling things . I have no idea what those lines deleted but just I just followed Mr. M’s commands to reinstall things that I probably already had installed but I just wanted to make sure . $ brew list # list packages $ brew update # update package list $ brew upgrade # upgrade packages $ brew install git # install latest git $ brew install python # install python3 for development $ python --version # version of python3 installed $ brew install java # openjdk install $ java --version # version of runtime $ javac --version # version of compiler (base) id:~$ conda --version (base) id:~$ conda install jupyter # install jupyter (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list installed kernels (base) id:~$ # start in home directory (base) id:~$ pip install bash_kernel # download bash kernel . This is when I realized that there might be something wrong with my bash because it gave me a weird response, and this is where I discovered that it was in fact broken . Step 3: Fix Bash . pip uninstall bash_kernel pip install bash_kernel . It then give me a list of conflicts because the things we needed installed were uninstalled . Type this commands into terminal: . conda install -c conda-forge rtree . For more information click: Link . Then, uninstall and reinstall bash again . pip uninstall bash_kernel pip install bash_kernel . And it fixed it somehow . Important note! . Don’t forget to reinstall things such as nbformat, or anything not covered by the conda-forge rtree line! It will cause issues later with Jupyter notebooks .",

          "title": "Tri 1 Blog",
          "content": "APCSP . I joined APCSP relatively new to coding, and pretty garbage at it. I remember making my “About Me Page” at the beginning of tri one, which was coded in HTML and consisted of an image and a couple &lt;p&gt; tags. I felt like I was about to be the next Bill Gates with these skills, but I was proven very wrong during the rest of the course. . Most of the time when Mr. M held TechTalks or our technical officers had a presentation on key topics, I used every ounce of my brain power to try and figure out what they were even talking about. Obviously, it didn’t work, and I spent most of the class very lost, stressed, and a little sad. . However, through this struggle I learned the magic of StackOverflow and my very smart teammates Akhil and Avinh. Whenever I had a I problem, I asked them and they would always help me. The very few instances in which they didn’t know why my code was broken, I went to Mr. M. . Now, this doesn’t sound like a very productive way to go through a computer science class, but as the class progressed, I slowly began learning more and more. Although I am no Anthony (an absolute legend), there were days when I made something good enough to make me feel like I was. . As the AP test approached, I genuinely thought I was going to fail because I was pretty incompetent and didn’t understand major concepts on College Board. So, I went on the grind, and started watching more CB videos and doing thorough test corrections on the practice AP tests we did in class. I got a 5 on the exam which was kind of a shocker . APCSA . Week 0: . I struggled to download literally everything because my computer is like jacked and just hates me. . Week 1: . After thinking I successfully downloaded everything, I realized my Java Kernel was broken and I had to go through this very long and painful process to fix it. In that process, I broke a lot of other things, which Mr. M so kindly fixed for me . Week 2: . I honestly don’t really understand what is going on right now. Java is significantly more confusing than Python and it lowkey hurts my brain. Doing the code.org lessons kind of helped, but I’m definitely struggling a lot. . Week 3: . I really enjoyed doing the boolean lab, it helped me solidify my knowledge of if-else and if-elseif-else statements. I learned about switch statements and De Morgan’s law. De Morgan’s law is a little confusing but I will pick it up eventually. My deployment mostly went smoothly besides the last step. I was able to get a domain and everything . Psychology and the Good Life: . We can control a lot more of our happiness than we think | Becoming happier takes a lot of effort | Money has a big influence on happiness Can create stress or pressure | . | . Like many others, I believe that success and prestige makes me happy. That’s why I stress so much about getting good grades, trying to get the best scores, and taking hard classes. I convince myself that the suffering and stress now will lead to happiness and wealth later. After watching this video, I’ve realized that although I want to be succesful, that is not the only thing that makes me happy. My friends, family, dog, videogames, and food are all things that make me happy. I also know that I have control over my mindset and actions, both of which influence a happy lifestyle. Living under the pressure of having to become what society deems “succesful” is hard, but the hardest kind of success is being happy with life and yourself. . Week 4: . I’m lowkey struggling with the array assignment thing because arrays confuse me. I don’t really understand how the whole printing thing works and all the different rows and columns. I enjoyed putting in my ASCII fish though. :) . Week 5: . My group has a good idea for a class manager for Mr. M and we made a wireframe and everything. I don’t really understand the fibo lab. I understand the concept of extends but have absolutely no idea how it works. . Week 6: . I was thinking of using a weather API to change the home page based on what the weather is outside. Our project is interesting to me because my teachers used to use a website called class dojo and I think it’d be cool if I could make something similar to that. The array images assignment was somewhat comprehensible and I was able to fix the scaling of the ASCII image. . Week 7: . I watched a YouTube video of some guy explaining arrayList and made a notebook page that is like a reference for me. I actually understand the purpose of an arrayList. I tried making a student arrayList and practiced adding and editing the values in the list. We have a very rough draft of our website going, but backend and frontend are not connected yet. . Week 8: . We were supposed to have presentations on Unit 1 and Unit 2 but since there was the plague going around school it was cancelled. . Week 9: . We made a video of our website and everyone’s role. Since I’m the scrum master, I basically explained all the collaboration and tools we are using to work on our website. We also got presentations on Unit 3-5. . Week 10: . We had a presentation on Arrays. Afterwards, Mr. M told us that we weren’t going to do anymore presentations because we needed to work on our projects. I’m slighly concerned given that our project barely had any features but I have confidence in my teammates . Week 11: . We were on the coding grind this week and were cranking out majority of our project this week. The day of Night at the M, we finally got frontend and backend working. Our project wasn’t great, but we at least had something tangible. . Week 12/AP MCQ . . Q17. Shift element in ID int array . . Wrong: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} Right: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7} . Explanation: The for loop control variable k starts with the value 3, is incremented by 1 and terminates the loop when its value is arr.length – 1. In the first iteration, when k is 3, arr[3] is assigned the value arr[4]. The contents of the arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7}. In the second iteration, when k is 4, arr[4] is assigned the value arr[5]. The contents of arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7}. In the third iteration, when k is 5, arr[5] is assigned the value arr[6]. The contents of arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7}. Then k is incremented to 6 and the loop terminates. . Q18. Generate random index for ArrayList . . Explanation: The indices for myList are 0 through myList.size() – 1, for a total of myList.size() elements. Using Math.random()generates a random floating point number between 0 and 1, not including 1. When this value is multiplied by the number of elements we want in our range, myList.size(), a random floating point number between 0 and myList.size(), not including myList.size(), is generated. When this value is typecast as an int, the result is an integer value between 0 and myList.size() – 1 inclusive. . Q23. Manipulate method and animals List . . Wrong: [“bear”, “baboon”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”] Right: [“bear”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”, “baboon”] . Explanation: List is an interface, which an ArrayList implements. Please note that List is no longer tested as part of the AP CSA exam and ArrayList will be used instead. The manipulate method contains a for loop with a loop control variable k that starts at the right most index of animals, decrements by 1 each time, until k is equal to 0. In the first iteration, when k is 5, if the element of animals at 5 (“baboon”) starts with a “b”, which it does, then this value is removed from the list and inserted at index 1. The list would then be {“bear”, “baboon”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”}. In the second iteration, when k is 4, the element of animals at 4 (“cat”) does not start with a “b” and no changes are made to the list. In the third iteration, when k is 3, the element of animals at 3 (“bass”) starts with a “b”. This value is removed from the list and inserted at index 3. Since it was already at index 3, the list would not change. In the fourth iteration, when k is 2, the element of animals at 2 (“zebra”) does not start with a “b” and no changes are made to the list. In the fifth iteration, when k is 1, the element of animals at 1 (“baboon”) starts with a “b”. It is removed from the list and inserted at index 5. The list would then be {“bear”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”, “baboon”}. Finally, k decrements to 0 which is not greater than 0 so the loop terminates. . Q24. Translate 1D array into 2D array enhanced for . . Wrong: 8 Right: 7 . Explanation: The enhanced for loop iterates over the array oldArray. In the first iteration, newArray[0][0] is assigned the value 1. The value of row is incremented to 1. Since 1 % 3 does not equal 0, the statements in the if are not executed. In the next iteration, newArray[1][0] is assigned the value 2. The value of row is incremented to 2. The algorithm continues to fill column 0 with the subsequent values of oldArray. Once row is 3, the if condition is true and row is assigned 0 and col is incremented to 1. The algorithm proceeds to fill column 1. When the for loop terminates, newArray contains the following values { {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8}, {3, 6, 9} }. The value of newArray[0][2] is 7. . Q30. Scramble method with String and int parameters . . Wrong: “ilercomp” Right: “ilercom” . Explanation: The two parameter substring method returns the substring beginning at the first parameter and ending at the second parameter – 1. When word is assigned “compiler” and howFar is assigned 3, the value of word.substring(howFar + 1, word.length()) is “iler”. This is the substring of “compiler” beginning at 3 + 1 or 4 and ending at 8 – 1 or 7. The value of word.substring(0, howFar) is “com”. This is the substring of “compiler” beginning at 0 and ending at 2. The method returns “ilercom”. . Q34. Point and Circle Classes . . Wrong: II and III only Right: II only . Explanation: Choice I uses the no parameter Point constructor to assign center a new Point with x and y both equal to 0, instead of x assigned the value a and y assigned the value b. Choice II correctly uses the two parameter Point constructor to create a new Point with x assigned the value a and y assigned the value b. Choice III uses the no parameter Point constructor to assign center a new Point with x and y both equal to 0. It attempts to update x and y, however since they are private instance variables in Point, they are not able to be accessed directly in Circle. This code will cause a compile time error. . Q39. Recur method with int parameter . . Wrong: 9 Right: 16 . Explanation: The call recur(27) returns the value of recur(recur(9)) since 27 is greater than 10. The call recur(9) returns 18, since 9 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(recur(9)) is recur(18). The call recur(18) returns recur(recur(6)) since 18 is greater than 10. The call recur(6) returns 12, since 6 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(recur(6)) is recur(12). The call recur(12) returns recur(recur(4)) since 12 is greater than 10. The call recur(4) returns 8, since 4 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(recur(4)) is recur(8). The call recur(8) returns 16, since 8 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(27)returns the value of 16. . Reflection: I missed 5 questions from unit 2 and 2 questions from unit 1, so I think those are areas that I need to focus on a little more. I tend to have difficulty fully understanding code, and I think I need to work on taking my time when reading it and trying to break it down piece by piece. .",

          "content": "Week 13 . I started working on the College Board FRQ 1 before doing Mr. M’s more advanced hacks. I felt that this would be a better start for me since I struggle a lot with the Java concepts. I was kind of able to figure out how to do FRQ 1 by myself, so I moved onto the hacks. I made a couple methods myself, but ended up working with Evan on the harder ones. Honestly, he figured it out and made most of it because I had no idea what to do. He helped me understand what his code does which is very appreciated. We were also supposed to figure out how to add more endpoints, but I barely know what an endpoint is so I couldn’t do that. . Turkey . Over turkey, I tried to do FRQ 2. I realized I have no idea what is going on but I remained determined to at least finish part of the hacks. I had some people help me because I didn’t even know where to start and I was able to finish a few of the hacks. I somewhat understand what I did, and I hope to do better on future assignments. . Week 14 . I’ve been working on the vocab this week and it has been quite nice to slow down on the FRQs and take time to expand my Java knowledge. On Wednesday, my scrum team presented our presentation for the arrayList lesson and I think it went pretty well. .",

          "content": "Capture Information Plan: . This is where I will store most of my general notes. If there is specific information either college board or PBL, I will label it by unit or lab. . Some Key Terms in Java: . The main method is where the program starts running. | Objects are an instance of a class. Objects can have attributes. For instance, a Student object might have name and grade as attributes. | A class is a programmer defined blueprint from which objects are created. Ex: Class is ClubMember Attributes: Name, grade | . | . | A parameter is a variable in the method/constructor signature that defines the type of value to receive when the method or constructor is called. | An argument is a value passed to a method or constructor when the method or constructor is called. | Super class is a class that can be extended to create subclasses | Subclass is a class that extends a superclass and inherits its attributes and behaviors | Inheritence is an OOP principle where a subclass inherits the attributes nad behaviors of a superclass | Concatenation is joining two strings together | . 8/30 Using Objects . Public means availible everywhere | Final means that its not going anywhere | myPainter.move(); (.) notation means that you’re using objects | Refrencing data property or refrencing method | myPainter is object | .move(); is a method | . | . Unit 6 Inheritence . Instantiate an object . ClassName objectName = new ClassName(); // example PainterPlus myPainterPlus = new PainterPlus(); . Creating a subclass . public class Subclass extends SuperClass { public Subclass() { super(); } } . Unit 7 Writing a Method . . public class PainterPlus extends Painter{ public PainterPlus(){ super(); } public void turnRight(){ turnLeft(); turnLeft(); turnLeft(); } } . //Unit 9 While Loops Control Structure: A conditional or iteration statement which affects the flow of a program . . //Unit 10 Two Way Selection Logical Operators . Put in front of condition | . NOT (!) - Returns opposite of operand . public void moveOrTakePaint(){ while (canMove()) if (!isOnBucket()){ move(); } else takePaint(); } . Array List . Arrays are used when you have a collection of the same type of elements Ex: array of numbers, string array | . | Arrays have a fixed size | ArrayLists don’t have a fixed size, can change their size | . Unit 01 Primitive Types . . Java Type Casting . Widening Casting (automatically): converting a smaller type to a larger type size byte -&gt; short -&gt; char -&gt; int -&gt; long -&gt; float -&gt; double . Narrowing Casting (manually): converting a larger type to a smaller size type double -&gt; float -&gt; long -&gt; int -&gt; char -&gt; short -&gt; byte . Java Operators . . Incrementing and Decrementing: ++ or – . Unit 02 Using Objects . OOP (Object Oriented Programming): A programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects. . . Classes: Templates/blueprints from which objects are creaeted. Objects under the same class with share common methods/attributes . Ex: Class fruit can have the objects apple, bananas, and orange Ex: Class attributes (inherited by objects) could be calorie count, quantity, etc . Objects: Instances of a class . Ex: Painter myPainter = new Painter(); . Methods: Functions that perform a specific task . Ex: Methods of the class could be store, cosume, etc . . Unit 03 Boolean Expressions and If Statements . Boolean Expressions: true or false . Conditional Statements: Perform condition depending if it is true or false . . Else if: Adds conditions to if-else statements . Compound Boolean Expressions: . Nested if statements: if statements within if statements | Logical operators: &amp;&amp; and |   | or ! not | . | Short-circuited evaluations: Knowing the result of a compound boolean just by glancing at the expressions | De-Morgan’s law !(a &amp;&amp; b) = (!a || !b) !(a || b) = (!a &amp;&amp; !b) . | . Comparing Objects . == compare two object refrences are aliases for the same object | .equals() sees if the attributes of two objects are the same | . Unit 04 Iteration . While Loops . //example 1 int x = 5; // The boolean expression in this case is x &gt; 0 while (x &gt; 0) { System.out.println(x); x--; } //example 2 int[] array = {3, 7, 0, 2, 4, 5, 9, 1, 3, 6, 3}; int total = 0; int i = 0; while (i &lt; array.length) { total += array[i]; i++; } System.out.println(total); . For Loops . //format for (initialize; test condition; change) { loop body } . //example 1 for (int x = 1; x &lt;= 5; x++) { System.out.println(x); } . Loops and Strings . String name = &quot;CodeCodeCode&quot;; for (int i = 0; i &lt; name.length(); i+=2) { System.out.println(name.substring(i,i+2)); } . Nested Iteration . for (int row = 0; row &lt; 5; row ++) { for (int column = 0; column &lt; 4; column++) { System.out.print(&#39;*&#39;); } System.out.println(); } . For Each Loops . //format for(dataType item : array) { ... } . //example 1 public class ForEachLoops { public static void main(String[] args) { // create an array int[] data = {2, 10, 5, 12}; // for each loop for (int number: data) { System.out.println(number); } } } . Unit 05 Writing Classes . . // Basic Java Class public class Snack { // class name always starts with capital letter /* * Instance variables * Always declared right after class declaration * Declared with TYPE and NAME */ private String name; private int calories; // constructor public Snack(String n, int c){ name = n; calories = c; } // methods public String getName(){ // accessor return name; } public void setName(String n){ // mutator name = n; } // main method public static void main(String[] args) { Snack one = new Snack(&quot;Oreos&quot;, 100); System.out.println(one.getName()); } } Snack.main(null); . Class: blueprint used to create objects . Instance variables | Constructors | Methods Accessors/getters | Mutator/Setters | Main method (tester) | . | . Objects: instances of a class . Access Modifiers . Public: no restricted access (Classes, constructors) | Private: restrict access to declaring calss (instance variables) | Methods can be public or private | . Data Encapsulation . Data can be accessible, modifiable, both, or neither | Variables and methods are wrapped in a class | . Constructors . Initialize instance variables when an object is created | Object state: Attributes of an object and their values at a given time | .",
