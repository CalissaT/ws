    "#### Building the Car Sprite\n",
    "Create a new 2D Project. The first thing that we need for our Pizza Delivery game is a car. To create a \"car\" we must start with building a sprite. In Unity, a sprite refers to a 2D graphic or image that can be used to represent objects, characters, backgrounds, or other visual elements in a game or application. Sprites are widely used in 2D game development to create the visual components of the game world.\n",
    "> <mark>A little more information from ChatGPT about sprites:</mark> Once imported, sprites can be placed in the game scene and manipulated using Unity's 2D tools. They can be moved, scaled, rotated, and layered to create dynamic and interactive visuals. Sprites can also be animated by changing their appearance over time, which is achieved by swapping between different sprite images or by utilizing sprite animation systems available in Unity.\n",
    " Unity provides various components and features to work with sprites efficiently. The Sprite Renderer component is used to render and display sprites in the scene. It allows you to assign a sprite to a GameObject and control its properties, such as color, sorting order, and flip state.\n",
    " In addition to the Sprite Renderer, Unity offers tools for physics-based interactions with sprites, such as the 2D Colliders, Rigidbody 2D, and other physics components. These enable sprites to respond to collisions, forces, and gravity, creating realistic and engaging gameplay."

    "#### Capsule sprite\n",
    "To create our car sprite, we will use a capsule shape. In the Unity Editor, right-click in the Project window or right click on the \"Main Camera\", then select \"Create 2D Object\" choose \"Sprite\" then choose \"Capsule.\" The path is shown in the picture below. To resize the car select the object titled \"Capsule\" in the left side panel under \"Main Camera\" and a box will appear around the car. Drag in the sides of the box to make the capsule smaller. That's it! You've successfully created a 2D capsule sprite in Unity, though it doesn't look much like a car, but that's a later step. You are not only limited to capsule shapes however, you can make Squares, Circles, Polygons, and any other shape you can think of.\n",

    "### Let's Make This Car Move\n",
    "Here's where the code comes in. To make our car move, it must have Driver code. Driver code typically refers to the main or central part of a program that drives the execution and coordination of various components and systems. In Unity, this could be a script or a set of scripts that serve as the entry point or controller for the game or application. In our case, the Driver code literally allows us to drive the car. \n",

    "Our car driver code is made with C#. C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It emphasizes productivity, simplicity, and integration with the .NET framework. It supports key OOP concepts, provides a large standard library, and is commonly used for desktop, web, and mobile application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a new file to make the driver script, right click on the \"Assets\" menu, select \"Create\", then select \"C# Script.\" Rename the Script to be \"Driver.\" Then double click the script and it will open a window in Visual Studio Code. From there use this code to create a driver for your car. \n",

    "### Camera Control\n",
    "Let's take a quick break from the car to talk about the camera controls on Unity. By default the camera is set at size 5. This might too small or big depending on the size of your sprite. To make it bigger or smaller simply change the number that is there. You can control the camera by right clicking and holding to drag around the camera. "

    "### Having Fun With Collisions\n",
    "Now that our car can drive, wouldn't it be fun if it could hit other objects? To allow our car to hit other objects, we must first create other sprites of different shapes. Use the same process as creating a cat but instead create a circle or a square or both. Resize the circle and square to be an appropriate obstacle for the car (hint: later we turn these objects into a cone, so think about the size of a cone.). To change the color of the obstacle use the color option under the \"Sprite Renderer\" in the right panel. \n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Now lets make these objects able to interact with one another. To do this we will use the \"Box Collider 2D\" in Unity. A box collider in Unity is a component that defines a rectangular bounding volume for an object in a 3D scene. It is used for collision detection and physics simulation. The box collider's size can be adjusted to match the object's shape, and it interacts with other colliders to determine if and how objects collide with each other. For the collisons to occur, we must apply the box collider to both the car and the object it collides with. To do this you must select the sprite, click \"Add Component\" in the right toolbar, and search \"Capsule Collider 2D.\" The size of the colliding edge can be adjusted by selecting \"Edit Collider\" within the Box Collider 2D editor. Repeat this step for your circular or square object (using the \"Box Collider 2D\"), and make sure to save. Now when you play the game, the car should be able to hit this object without the box/circle moving. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Now let's say you have an object like a cone that is way lighter than a car, and should be able to move if it is hit with a car. Well, this is where our \"Rigidbody 2D\" comes in. A Rigidbody in Unity is a component that adds physics simulation to a game object. It allows the object to be affected by forces like gravity and collisions. The Rigidbody's properties, such as mass and drag, determine how it responds to external forces, making it an essential component for realistic physics-based movement and interaction in Unity games. In our case it will help the car move a cone or any other moveable object. To make this happen, add the \"Rigidbody 2D\" component to both the car and the object that you want to be able to move. Once you apply the Rigid Body setting, must change the Gravity Scale to 0 under the settings. This is because we are making a two down video game rather than a game that has a POV similar to Mario that would require gravity to bring the characters down. Save you settings then hit play to see it happen.\n",

    "### Making It Look the Part\n",
    "Wow our game is functioning amazingly, however the car does not really look like a car. Let's give it the right texture. To customize the appearance of a sprite in Unity, you can follow any of these steps depending on the look you are going for. First, select the sprite you want to modify in the Unity Editor. In the Inspector window, you can adjust various properties like color, transparency, and material. You can change the sprite's color by modifying the Sprite Renderer component's color property. To create more advanced effects, such as applying textures or shaders, you can assign a custom material to the Sprite Renderer which is what we will be doing. First up, we need a top down view of a car to use. To find one, look it up on google. This is the [one we used](). The image needs t have a transparent background. To upload this onto Unity, drag it from your file explorer into the \"Assets\" folder in the bottom left corner. Now let's apply this texture to the capsule. Select the capsule and open up the Sprite Renderer window. Then find the name of the image you just uploaded and double click to apply it. WOAH isn't that cool! Now we got a completely official car. This concept can be applied to anything that you build on Unity. Some items that we added to the game were traffic cones, pedestrians, streets, driveways, and houses but the possibilities are endless if you can find the image or draw it. "
